# MyBatis and Spring Boot Projects with Lombok

This repository contains two simple applications that demonstrate the usage of MyBatis and Spring Boot, along with the Lombok package, for building backend applications. These projects are based on the content and resources provided by the organization 黑马程序员 under the Bilibili tutorial JavaWeb开发教程.

## Project Descriptions

### CRUD Project

The CRUD project showcases how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations in a MySQL database using MyBatis and Spring Boot. The project utilizes the Lombok package to enhance code readability by reducing boilerplate code.

In this project, we demonstrate an Inversion of Control (IOC) and Dependency Injection (DI) mechanism provided by Spring Boot. Additionally, we show how MyBatis can effectively handle database operations by utilizing XML format for data manipulation instead of using decorator functions.

### MyBatis Quick Start Project

The MyBatis Quick Start project demonstrates how to quickly set up a MyBatis project using Spring Boot. This project serves as a starting point for building applications that require database operations using MyBatis. The Lombok package is also used in this project to improve code readability.

## Features

- Integration of MyBatis and Spring Boot for database operations
- Usage of Lombok to reduce boilerplate code and improve code readability
- Demonstration of the IOC and DI mechanism provided by Spring Boot
- Effective solution for CRUD operations using MyBatis and XML format for data manipulation
